# NS-3-Modified-Dumbbell-topology-TCP-UDP-Flows-DroptailQueue
NS-3 Modified Dumbbell topology(TCP/UDP Flows,DroptailQueue/Packetdrops) 

This code is written in ns-3.29 (slight code changes maybe required for other versions)

Note: As after ns-3.24 congestion avoidance algorithms has been implemented by default in ns3,Hence i didnt observe much tcp packet drops.
Data rate and some other vaues in the above codes are not according to the questions,change it as you wish.
